# Layout Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Layout feature is responsible for managing the main structure and navigation of the application. 
It provides a consistent layout across different sections of the app, including Home, Favorites, and Profile tabs.


## Data layer && Domain layer
    Data layer is not used in this feature because there's no business logic to handle. We just want to display the tabs.


## Presentation layer

### 1. LayoutView
- Main view that sets up the overall structure of the app.
- Implements the bottom navigation bar for switching between different tabs.

### 2. LayoutBloc
- Manages the state of the layout, including the currently selected tab.
- Handles events related to tab switching.

### 3. Tab Bodies
- HomeTabBody: Displays the content for the Home tab.
- FavoritesTabBody: Displays the content for the Favorites tab.
- ProfileTabBody: Displays the content for the Profile tab.

## Routing
The Layout feature is integrated into the app's routing system:
- Route: '/layout'
- Handled in AppRouter (lib/core/routing/app_router.dart)
- Uses BlocProvider to inject LayoutBloc
