# Meal Suggestion Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to input a list of ingredients, and an AI-powered system (using the Gemini API) suggests a meal based on those ingredients.

---

## Key Features
1. **Ingredient Input**: Users can enter multiple ingredients in a text field.
2. **AI-Powered Suggestions**: The app uses the Gemini API to fetch meal suggestions.
3. **Detailed Recipe Display**: Each suggestion includes:
   - Meal Name
   - Description
   - Ingredients
   - Instructions
   - (Optional) Nutritional Information

## Project Architecture
The feature is built following the **Clean Architecture** principles with the following structure:

- **Data Layer**:
  - Contains data sources and models for interacting with the Gemini API.
  - Handles network requests and data parsing.

- **Domain Layer**:
  - Defines use cases.

- **Presentation Layer**:
  - Built using Flutter.
  - Includes:
    - **UI Components**: Widgets for user interaction and recipe display.
    - **State Management**: Cubit is used to manage the state of the feature.

---

## Dependencies
- **Flutter Bloc**: For state management using Cubit.
- **MediaQuery**: To ensure responsive UI design.

---

## How It Works
1. User inputs ingredients into the text field.
2. The `SuggestedRecipeCubit` processes the input and fetches data from the Gemini API.
3. The app displays the recipe details dynamically in the UI.
