# Meal Details Feature

## Overview
The Meal Details feature provides a comprehensive view of a specific meal, including its image, name, cooking information, and detailed tabs for summary, ingredients, and cooking directions.

## Data layer && Domain layer
    No need for data & domain layers because there's no business logic to handle. We just want to display the UI.
